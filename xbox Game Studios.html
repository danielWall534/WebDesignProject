              <p2>Developer Bungie were acquired by Microsoft in 2000, and their in-development project Halo turned into a launch title for Microsoft's Xbox console. In 2007, shortly after shipping Halo 3, Bungie announced its split from Microsoft. The rights to Halo remained with the latter.
                To oversee the Halo franchise, Microsoft created 343 Industries that same year, named after Halo character 343 Guilty Spark. Bungie continued making Halo games until Halo: Reach in 2010.</p2>

                <h2>The History of Xbox</H2>
                  <p2>Microsoft Corporation created Xbox, a video game console system. Released in 2001, Xbox was Microsoft's first entry into the world of console electronic gaming, 
                      which placed it in direct competition with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's GameCube. </p2>
                      <p2>Concerned about Sony’s successful PlayStation console damaging the personal computer market, Microsoft initiated plans in 1999 to create its own console gaming system to both diversify its product line and capitalize on the thriving gaming industry. 
                        The system—originally termed the DirectX-box for its use of the eponymous video software—underwent multiple launch delays and several pricing adjustments after it made its debut. 
                        Despite popular titles such as Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, Microsoft reported in 2005 that it had thus far lost $4 billion from the Xbox enterprise.</p2>
